By piping data in between embedded webpages, you can:

 - Create wep applications that consist of multiple distinct websites.
 - Create plugins for existing webpage applications without having to embed or run any third party code.
 - Separate server code from client-only code.
 - Blur the distinction between server and client code.
 - Blur the distinction between plugins and applications.

Adding metaframe functionality to an existing webpage is very easy (see examples). The metaframe javascript library simply listens for pipe messages between pages/tabs/windows. It's up to your webpage to decide what to do with the piped inputs.



### Concepts

#### Iframe communication

The parent page that is running the app runs the iframe-app javascript code that communicates takes an application definition and returns a set of iframes connected together with window message events. The connection object establishes data pipes and API methods that the parent window creates.

Sequence of events:

	1) The parent window creates the child iframe.
	2) The iframe loads the client connection library. This sends a SetupIframeClientRequest to the parent.
	3) 


#### Metapage

Example yaml file

```
metapage:
  version: "0.1-alpha"
  iframes:
    name1:
      url: someurl
      in:
        input1:
          type: inline
          value: some value
        input2:
          type: url
          value: relative_url/value.txt
      out:
        out1: {}
        out2: {}
    name2:
      url: someurl
      in:
        input1:
          type: inline
          value: some value
        input2:
          type: url
          value: relative_url/value.txt
  pipes:
    - from:
        id: name1
        pipe: out1
      to:
        id: name2
        pipe: input
```



# Metaframes: building blocks

Metaframes (embedded websites) become input/output pipes. 


# Examples

The site: {{site.baseurl}}

# Use cases:

To run the examples, you'll need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

After you have installed docker:

  docker compose up

Then go to http://localhost:4000/test to browse the examples.
